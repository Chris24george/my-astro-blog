This blog will serve as a repository of knowledge—ideas I want to work through in writing or insights I’d like to share with others. The primary subjects I expect to write about include languages, philology, history, literature, and mathematics. However, I expect to occasionally delve into miscellaneous topics and write about my research in those areas as well.
